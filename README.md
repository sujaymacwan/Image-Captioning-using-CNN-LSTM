# Image-Captioning-using-CNN-LSTM
This repository implements an image captioning system that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction. The model generates descriptive captions for images, leveraging the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs.
